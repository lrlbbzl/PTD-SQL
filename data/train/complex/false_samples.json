To complete the second subproblem, we need to use tables ['film', 'inventory'].\n\n<3> Operation: For the first subproblem, use 'where' to filter using column 'amount' in table 'payment'. For the second subproblem, perform a 'GROUP BY' operation on the column 'film_id' and filter by performing 'HAVING COUNT()' on the column 'inventory_id'.\n\n<4> SQL Generation: Use 'intersect' operation to connect the queries of subproblems to form the final SQL statement.\n\nSQL query: \nSELECT T1.title, T1.film_id FROM film AS T1 JOIN inventory AS T2 ON T1.film_id = T2.film_id JOIN rental AS T3 ON T2.inventory_id = T3.inventory_id JOIN payment AS T4 ON T3.rental_id = T4.rental_id WHERE T4.amount = 0.99 INTERSECT SELECT T1.title, T1.film_id FROM film AS T1 JOIN inventory AS T2 ON T1.film_id = T2.film_id GROUP BY T1.film_id HAVING COUNT(T2.inventory_id)",
