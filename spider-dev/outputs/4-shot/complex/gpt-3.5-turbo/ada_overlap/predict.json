To complete the first subproblem, we need to use table ['TV_Channel']. To complete the second subproblem, we need to use tables ['TV_Channel', 'Cartoon'].\n\n<3> Operation: Use 'where' to filter using column 'Directed_by' in table 'Cartoon'.\n\n<4> SQL Generation: Use 'except' operation to connect the queries of subproblems to form the final SQL statement.\n\nSQL query: \nSELECT id FROM TV_Channel EXCEPT SELECT T1.id FROM TV_Channel AS T1 JOIN Cartoon AS T2 ON T1.id  =  T2.Channel WHERE T2.Directed_by  =  \"Ben Jones\"",
