The query emphasizes intersection logic, so we can decompose the question into two subproblems: 1. what are the countries of singers above age 40; 2. what are the countries of singers below age 30.\n\n<2> Schema Linking: In this step, we identify the tables and columns that should be used based on the requirements of the query and the foreign key relationships. To complete both subproblems, we need to use table 'singer'.\n\n<3> Operation: Use 'where' to filter using column 'Age' in table 'singer'.\n\n<4> SQL Generation: Use 'intersect' operation to connect the queries of subproblems to form the final SQL statement.\n\n", "predict": "SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM singer WHERE Age > 40 INTERSECT SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM singer WHERE Age < 30"}]
