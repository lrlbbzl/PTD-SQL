Let's think step by step.  <1> Operation: The query requires the department name and the average salary of employees in each department, so we should apply the 'average' operation to the 'Salary' column in the 'Employees' table and group the result by the 'Department_Name' column in the 'Departments' table.  <2> Schema Linking: In this step, we identify the tables and columns that should be used based on the first step and the foreign key relationships. In this question, we only need to use tables ['Employees', 'Departments'].  <3>
