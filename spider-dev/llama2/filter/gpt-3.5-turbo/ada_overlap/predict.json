Secondly, we need to retrieve the feature type name of that feature.\n\n<2> Schema Linking: In this step, we identify the tables and columns that should be used based on the first step and the foreign key relationships. We need to select the row from the 'Other_Available_Features' table where the 'feature_name' is \"AirCon\". Then, we need to retrieve the corresponding 'feature_type_code' from that row and find the matching 'feature_type_name' in the 'Ref_Feature_Types' table.\n\n<3> SQL Generation: Use 'where' to filter the rows where 'feature_name' is \"AirCon\" in the 'Other_Available_Features' table. Then, join the 'Other_Available_Features' table with the 'Ref_Feature_Types' table on the 'feature_type_code' column.
